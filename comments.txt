So your input seems to be working as expected, which is great. You don't really need to wrap each of these input requests in a function: you could just have raw input in a sequence in the main space of the program. The next phase, I think, is going to be doing something with the user's input: what can you do to react to particular kind of input? That is, right now, the user is just inputting data, and your program is, in a way, indifferent to it. How can you change that and make the program both interactive and reactive?

You're definitely taking steps to respond to user input. I'd encourage you to keep taking steps with that, since it's still minimal. Perhaps consider looking up how to write a file with the output. That is, you could save the user's input in a text file called journal.txt or something. A quick google search for 'python write text file' should give you some instructions, and of course I'm always happy to help as well.
