So your input seems to be working as expected, which is great. You don't really need to wrap each of these input requests in a function: you could just have raw input in a sequence in the main space of the program. The next phase, I think, is going to be doing something with the user's input: what can you do to react to particular kind of input? That is, right now, the user is just inputting data, and your program is, in a way, indifferent to it. How can you change that and make the program both interactive and reactive?
